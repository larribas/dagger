# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to _Dagger_.

All kinds of contributions are welcome. We only ask you to follow some rules of thumb to make the community around _Dagger_ as welcoming and productive as possible:

1. Abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
1. Take a look at our [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and [Open Issues](https://github.com/larribas/dagger/issues) to understand where the library is at, and where it is going.
1. Share your ideas with the community and core contributors before implementing them. Explain what you have in mind, your motivations. You can reach us using [GitHub Discussions](TODO) or directly to me (@larribas) via [email: dagger@larribas.me](mailto:dagger@larribas.me).


If you want to contribute and you're not sure how, here are some ideas:

- Writing tutorials or blog posts.
- Improving the documentation.
- Submitting bug reports and use cases.
- Implementing a new runtime (e.g. support for Airflow, Jenkins, Flyte, etc.)
- Implementing new serializers that may be useful for the community at large.
- Sharing, discussing, researching and exploring new ideas.


We're looking forward to see your contributions.
