# Argo Runtime

The Argo runtime allows us to run our DAGs on [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/).


## Custom Resources

_Argo Workflows_ is a pipeline orchestrator that runs on top of Kubernetes.

It creates a handful of [Custom Kubernetes Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/): `Workflow`, `CronWorkflow` and `WorkflowTemplate`, among others.

Argo expects workflows to be expressed declaratively (usually using YAML), folliwing the [specification](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/fields/) of those resources.

Here are [some examples](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/tree/7684ef4a0c5f57e8723dc8e4d3a17246f7edc2e6/examples) that show how `Workflow` manifests look like.


## Generating Manifests

The Argo runtime exposes a series of methods to generate manifests for the custom resources mentioned in the previous section.

This is how you would generate different resource manifests using the Argo runtime:


=== "Workflow"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/workflow.py"
    ```

=== "Cron Workflow"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/cron_workflow.py"
    ```

=== "Workflow Template"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/workflow_template.py"
    ```

=== "Cluster Workflow Template"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/cluster_workflow_template.py"
    ```


### Why do we need container images and entrypoints

_Argo Workflows_ will execute each of the tasks in your DAG using a container.


This requires you to build a container image that can run the DAG's tasks.

Building container images is out of the scope of this guide, but the official [Python Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) provides some useful examples.

Once you've built a container, you need to specify which entrypoint of that container is able to execute the DAG through the command-line interface provided by the [CLI runtime](cli.md).

Here is an example project that defines a DAG, exposes it through the CLI runtime, specifies how to build a container image using a Dockerfile, and finally has a script that generates the Argo manifests and dumps them into a YAML file.

=== "my_pipeline.py"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/cli_runtime/imperative.py"
    ```

=== "Dockerfile"

    ```docker
    FROM python:3

    WORKDIR /usr/src/app

    COPY requirements.txt ./
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    COPY . .

    ENTRYPOINT [ "python" ]
    ```

=== "generate_manifests.py"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/generate_manifests.py"
    ```



## Runtime options

Many of Argo's features are not first-class citizens in _Dagger_. For instance:

- _Dagger_ doesn't understand that tasks may have timeouts or retry strategies.
- _Dagger_ doesn't understand that tasks may have resource requests or limits.
- _Dagger_ doesn't understand that you may want to fine-tune how your tasks are scheduled in your Kubernetes cluster, and use node selectors, tolerations or affinities.

However, _Dagger_ allows you to set all of these settings together with the behavior of your task, so you don't lose your head doing complex post-processing of the manifests, or defining all these options in a separate configuration file.


=== "Container options"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/extra_container_options.py"
    ```

=== "Template options"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/extra_template_options.py"
    ```

=== "DAG Template options"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/extra_dag_template_options.py"
    ```

=== "Workflow options"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/extra_workflow_options.py"
    ```

=== "Cron Workflow options"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/extra_cron_options.py"
    ```




### Enforcing your Company's Conventions and Standards

The Argo runtime allows you to specify arbitrary options for many of the elements in the `Workflow` specification.

Nevertheless, when implementing _Dagger_ inside of a large corporation, platform teams may want to enforce certain conventions and standards to comply with the company's governance, cost, observability or compliance policies.

The following example shows how easy it is to extend the existing decorators to provide a more opiniontated API and ease the day-to-day of both platform teams and _Dagger_ users in the organization.

```python
--8<-- "docs/code_snippets/argo_runtime/syntax_sugar.py"
```

This example was taken from [Glovo](https://glovoapp.com/), which has been the first company to adopt _Dagger_.
