# Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide!

Here you can find an in-depth explanation of the different components of _Dagger_. Namely:

- The [Data Structures](dags/introduction.md) used to build DAGs and connect different nodes in the graph.
- The [Serializers](serializers/alternatives.md) used to transmit data across different nodes.
- A [Domain-Specific Language (DSL)](dsl/imperative.md) that makes building DAGs a piece of cake.
- The [Runtimes](runtimes/alternatives.md) that execute a DAG or prepare it for execution on a distributed system.


Each subsection discusses the decisions that went into the design of each of these components, as well as their current capabilities and limitations.

For advanced users, we also show you how you can extend _Dagger_ and implement your own Serializers and Runtimes.
