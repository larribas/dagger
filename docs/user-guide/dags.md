# DAGs

Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) __describe how multiple nodes are connected to each other__.

Nodes in a DAG may be either Tasks or other DAGs (that is, you are allowed to [nest DAGs](dag-composition.md) inside of other DAGs).

Nodes are connected to each other through their inputs and outputs. If a node `x` has an input that depends on the output of another node `y`, _Dagger_ will register a dependency of `y -> x`, and runtimes will execute `x` before `y` according to their [topological ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20topological,before%20v%20in%20the%20ordering.&text=Topological%20sorting%20has%20many%20applications,such%20as%20feedback%20arc%20set.).

__All dependencies in _Dagger_ are defined implicitly by the relationship between the nodes' inputs and outputs__. It is not possible to declare a dependency explicitly. If two nodes do not depend on each other's outputs, _Dagger_ will assume they can be executed independently, potentially in parallel.

Like tasks, DAGs have inputs and outputs:

* A DAG input may come from a parameter, or from the output of a sibling node.
* __A DAG output must come from the output of one of its nodes__.



## 💡 Example

The following code snippet describes a simple DAG that mocks a simplified training pipeline for a Machine Learning model.

The DAG has 3 tasks:

* A first task prepares the training and test datasets for the model (note how the task has 2 outputs).
* A second task trains the model based on the training dataset.
* A third task measures the performance of the trained model against the test dataset.

## ➡️ Inputs

A DAG can have multiple inputs.

Inputs can come:

* `#!python FromParam(name: str)`. This indicates the input comes from a parameter named `name`, supplied when the DAG is executed.
* `#!python FromNodeOutput(node: str, output: str)`. This indicates the input comes from an output named `output`, which comes from another node named `node`. The current DAG and the node must be siblings in the same parent DAG.


## ⬅️ Outputs

A DAG does not produce outputs of its own. Instead, it just exposes the output(s) of some of its nodes. Thus, outputs are always of type: `#!python FromNodeOutput(node: str, output: str)`, where `node` points to the name of one of the DAG's nodes, and `output` to the name of the output to expose from that node.


## ⛔ Limitations

DAGs are validated against the following rules:

- DAGs should have at least one node. There would be no point in having an empty DAG.
- Node names must be 1-64 characters long, begin by a letter or number, and only contain letters, numbers and hyphens.
- Input and output names have the same constraints as node names, but they can also contain underscores.
- If a node input comes `#!python FromParam(name: str)`, then the DAG must have an input named `name`.
- If a node input comes `#!python FromNodeOutput(node: str, output: str)`, then the DAG must contain a node named `node` which exposes an output named `output`.
- DAGs may not contain cyclic dependencies. A cyclic dependency occurs whenever there is a chain of nodes `{n(1), n(2), ..., n(last)}` so that every `n(i)`  depends on an output of `n(i-1)`, but `n(1)` also contains an input that depends on the output of `n(last)`.
