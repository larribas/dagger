# AsPickle

`AsPickle` serializes values to and from Python's [Pickle protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).

The Pickle protocol has no limitations as far as serializing native Python objects goes.

Nevertheless, __we strongly recommend you read the warnings in the official documentation, and the comparison with other kinds of serializers__ to understand the behavior and the dangers of pickle serialization.
